## makeCacheMatrix : Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly 

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getsolve <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsole,
       getsolve = getsolve)
  
}

## cacheSolve : This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by  makeCacheMatrix  above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then  cacheSolve  should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getsolve()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(m)
  m     
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
